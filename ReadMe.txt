Welcome to this project!
This is a nice project involving a weather station. 
This is why it is called Meteo Hub 2.0 (in Italian it is "weather hub"), 
where 2.0 is to replace the previous project of the now removed Meteo Hub.
I will publish ALL the material needed to build the project: the necessary 
libraries and all the necessary diagrams and connections will be added!
